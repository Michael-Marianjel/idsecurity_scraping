" Zebra ZC100 Single-Sided Photo ID System Description ADVANCED SECURITY
Printer and host authentication Advanced security features enable printer-to-host authentication to prevent printing from unauthorized applications or devices.
AES data encryption Government-grade encryption protects the most sensitive data during printing, such as account numbers.
FAST AND FLEXIBLE PRINTING
Fast single-sided color and monochrome printing We took a good thing and made it better. The ZC100 prints up to 30% faster in monochrome and 15% faster in color than its predecessor, Zebra?€?s ZXP Series 1 card printers.
Basic encoding options Whether you are printing employee badges, ID cards, season passes and membership cards or credit and debit cards, you can choose the encoding option of your choice. Add a ?€?swipe-andgo?€? magnetic stripe when you print cards. Or use the ZIP Pocket with our new Software Development Kits (SDKs) to easily add a third party contactless encoder to create ?€?pass through?€? contactless cards.
