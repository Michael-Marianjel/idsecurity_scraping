" Zebra ZC350 Single Sided Photo ID System Description When you want it all in a card printer, the ZC350 delivers. Advanced printing options allow you to create virtually any design you can dream up. With support for just about every encoding technology, you can create just about any type of card ?€? credit, debit, identity, access, loyalty, public transportation passes and more. You get the fastest print speeds ?€? up to twice as fast as some competitive printers. With its cool design, the slimmest profile and the lowest clearance, the ZC350 can fit in more spaces than any other printer in its class. The ZC350 Series ?€? the card printer that delivers it all.
Highly graphical LED/LCD interface
The ZC350 offers highly-intuitive well-tested icons, animations and text-based messages in your own language, allowing any user to easily understand what the printer needs and how to perform virtually any function ?€? including how to clear a printer jam, fix a ribbon, load a ribbon or cards and more.
Easily print practically any design you can imagine
The ZC350 is loaded with advanced card production features. Print what you want, when you want, from just about anywhere ?€? edge-to-edge monochrome and color cards, with new ribbons that offer specialty colors and special effects. For example, a new pearlescent ribbon enables you to embed color-shifting graphics that are hard to counterfeit, improving card security. Make logos, text or account numbers stand out with 3D style effects that can be created with a new metallic color ribbon. And a new long life ribbon provides two new capabilities. You can embed a watermark graphic that can only be seen when the card is tilted at an angle or under UV light, improving security. And you can add a highly durable protective layer to create cards that will last for three to five years. And even the most complex design is as easy to print as a basic black and white card.
Painless plug-and-play set-up
The ZC350 is designed to work right out of the box. There?€?s no time-consuming complicated set-up ?€? just plug it in and start reaping the benefits the day your printer arrives.
A new ingenious card feeder handles??varying card thickness on-the-fly
The card feeder instantly adjusts to the thickness of each card ?€? no more adjusting for different card stocks. Zebra ZC350 Single Sided Photo ID System Specifications STANDARD FEATURES 300 dpi (11.8 dots/mm) print resolution

East to use system. Can set up in a morning. Print quality is very clear. Justin S What did you use the printer for:??Everything - Access control, gift cards, etc. How was your overall experience: Was the printer user friendly: Would you recommend the printer: How was the print quality: I originally purchased this printer to create access control cards. I also purchased blank PVC cards to create gift cards - I can honestly say the are as good, if not better quality as the ones you would get from any store. The printer is reliable and fast. The ONLY downside is that it does not come with any design software. Not a big deal because you can print from any application (word, photoshop, etc). Other than that, it has been VERY reliable and of great quality. Working with IDSecurity online was a great experience. Printer came quickly, and they kept in touch with me every step of the way. I looked for quite some time for a good id printer, and I am very satisfied with the Evolis. Back to Top 162

" Fargo HDP5600 Single Sided ID Card System Description Take high definition cards to the next level with the precision print quality of the FARGO?? HDP5600
Sharper, crisper images and text for any organization.
Colors are vibrant. Images and text are crisp. Quality is second to none. ID cards printed on the FARGO?? HDP5600 card printer/encoder do more than protect your organization ?€? they reflect the value you place on your brand. The HDP5600 produces ID cards with the highest image and text quality available, making it a smart choice for retail stores, recreation facilities, and any organization whose brand image is paramount. Not only are colors more brilliant and images sharper, but the high quality, 600 dpi resin printing capabilities of the HDP5600 give you the ability to precisely print small text and crisply defined barcodes like never before. The HDP5600 also includes a built-in Workbench??? diagnostic utility and Color Assist??? tool to help your organization better match spot colors on company logos and service marks. Leveraging the 600 dpi option, the printer can even accurately reproduce complex characters, such as Kanji, Arabic and Cyrillic.
It?€?s also right for organizations that demand more functionality from their ID cards. Government agencies, healthcare facilities, businesses and corporations, loyalty and membership programs, and colleges and universities are all expanding their use of multi-function smart cards. Encoding options allow configuration of the HDP5600 to produce highly secure contact and contactless smart cards that address your specific needs. And print quality is never sacrificed: because these precise images and text are printed onto high-definition film, instead of the directly to the card, the often uneven surface of technology cards won?€?t compromise image quality. The HDP5600 can also print up to the very edge of smart chip contacts and virtually over the edge of each card so images are always sharp. The printer?€?s Wi-Fi?? capabilities also allow you to produce high definition IDs anytime, anywhere. A retail chain, for example, can distribute card issuance over a network to any location. On a corporate campus or university, an array of printer/encoders can be set up in a central location for high-volume production. The printer?€?s Ethernet port and internal print server provide the connectivity needed for virtually any networked operation. Proven fifth-generation HDP?? technology and reliability.
HID Global introduced high definition printing (HDP) in 1999, and we?€?ve been perfecting the technology ever since. The HDP5600 reflects our commitment to customer-inspired innovation and the evolution of our family of High Definition Printing solutions. Reliable and robust, HID Global?€?s fifth-generation HDP5600 card printer/ encoder offers the print quality your organization can count on and the technology advancements you want. What?€?s more, fifth-generation reliability means more peace of mind and less printer downtime -- and because the printhead never comes in contact with card surfaces or debris, it?€?s never damaged in the printing process. In fact, it carries a lifetime warranty.
Greater card security and durability.
Cards produced by high definition printing solutions are more secure and durable than other types of cards. They are inherently tamperevident ?€? if a counterfeiter tries to peel apart the layers, the image essentially destroys itself. They also resist wear and tear by putting a durable layer of HDP film between the card image and the outside world.
For enhanced durability and security, the highly versatile HDP5600 also provides the ability to add a holographic overlaminate or holographic HDP film to the front of an ID card. An overlaminate on both sides doubles the protection ?€? and the HDP5600 laminates both sides of a card simultaneously in one efficient pass.
Take card printing to the next level.
Only one card printer offers 5th generation retransfer technology for every need ?€? from sharp and vibrant photo ID cards to multi-functional, high-security applications, the HDP5600 delivers on the promise of ultimate image quality and printer reliability, all at an affordable price point.

Encoding options allow configuration of the HDP6600 to produce highly secure contact and contactless smart cards that address your specific needs. The HDP6600 can also print up to the very edge of smart chip contacts and virtually over the edge of each card resulting in professional and polished credentials. The optional card flattener ensures a smooth and level finished card every time.
Wasteless lamination for highly durable cards at a fraction of the cost.
The HDP6600 utilizes HID Global?€?s innovative wasteless lamination technology, eliminating the need for the standard carrier film and take-up core included in most lamination consumables on the market today. As the only desktop-based retransfer on the market to offer advanced wasteless lamination technology, the HDP6600 can substantially reduce high-volume laminate materials costs by as much as 40%. Beyond consumables cost savings, wasteless PolyGuard??? LMX overlaminates extend the life of your cards by providing the highest level of card coverage protection available.

" Magicard Ultima Single Sided ID Card System Description Powered by a high-grade processing unit with an impressive array of features, Ultima is ideal for the localised or centralised issue of high-volumes of secure smart cards.
An intuitive touch screen, with print preview and supplies indicators, provides an easy-to-use interface to Magicard's most advanced and durable print engine.
Ultima enables you to print up to 100 high definition full colour cards per hour. The quality of print means staff can quickly and easily identify the facial features on ID cards for comparison against the holder. This makes it the ideal solution for drivers'??licences, national ID cards and other cards where security is paramount. The Ultima retransfer printer comes with built-in visual security via the use of up to 10 secure HoloKote?? watermarks. That means that if you choose to do so, you can distinguish different departments with a separate holographic design. For additional built-in security, Ultima exploits the wavelengths of the dye-film so it can fluoresce under UV lighting.
High capacity consumables (1000 prints) and hoppers, combined with a range of encoding options to write secure electronic data to the card, make the Ultima ideal for high volume localised or centralised issuance of secure smart cards. Magicard Ultima Single Sided ID Card System Specifications Printer technology 300dpi retransfer
HoloKote?? card security
